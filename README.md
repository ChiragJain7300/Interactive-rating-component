### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

The major challenges I faced during this project was figuring out how the user would select and submit rating. 
First I thought of using a checkbox or radio input type inside a form but that would require a server to handle the form data which was not recommended in this project and also make the project very complex. 
But I was thinking completely wrong, as this could done by adding event listeners which I had figured out and hence used it in the project.
